# API Documentation

Technical reference for integrating with Cynteo Alert Bridge.

---

## Webhook Endpoint

Alert Bridge provides a secure webhook endpoint that accepts Azure Monitor alerts.

### Endpoint URL

After deployment, a unique webhook URL is generated for your instance. This URL is:
- Automatically configured in your Action Groups during setup
- Protected with signature-based authentication
- Unique to your deployment

**üîí Security:** The webhook URL contains authentication tokens and should be kept confidential.

## Testing the Integration

### Using Azure Action Group Test

The easiest way to test Alert Bridge:

1. Go to **Azure Portal** ‚Üí **Monitor** ‚Üí **Action groups**
2. Select your action group
3. Click **"Test"**
4. Select the webhook action
5. Click **"Test"**
6. Check SolarWinds for the test incident

### Using Azure Alerts

Fire a real alert to test end-to-end functionality:

1. Create a test alert rule with easy-to-trigger conditions
2. Wait for the alert to fire
3. Verify incident appears in SolarWinds
4. Check that all fields are populated correctly

---

## Integration Security

### Webhook Authentication

- Each deployment has a unique, signed webhook URL
- Authentication is handled automatically
- URLs contain time-limited signatures

### Best Practices

- **Keep webhook URLs confidential** - treat them like passwords
- **Use Azure Action Groups** - don't share webhook URLs externally
- **Monitor for unauthorized access** - review execution logs regularly

---

## Monitoring Integration Health

### Check Processing Status

You can monitor Alert Bridge processing through Azure:

1. **Azure Portal** ‚Üí Your Alert Bridge resource
2. View **Run History** to see recent alert processing
3. Check for any failures or errors
4. Review execution times

### Common Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Succeeded** - Alert processed and incident created/updated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Failed** - Error occurred (check details)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Skipped** - Alert filtered (by severity or other rules)
